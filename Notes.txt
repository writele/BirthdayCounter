- In your PreCoursework, you've been going over the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You may be wondering how you can put all of these pieces together to build a functioning website. In this video, we're going to combine CSS, HTML, and Javascript to build a count-down application. The user will be able to enter the month and day of their birthday, and our program will tell them how many days are left until their birthday.

- Code zip will be in description?

- Let's get start. Open up Visual Studio and start a new website. For any website, we're going to need a HTML file. We'll need to add references to our Javascript and CSS files. To make things look a little nicer, we're going to use Bootstrap. We'll also use jQuery so we'll need to download and reference to both of these files.

< getbootstrap.com >

< jquery.com > 

- First we'll reference both these files.

- We're using jquery because it makes it easier to do things like grab and add things to the DOM

- For our custom js, we'll create a new file called app.js (and reference that)

- For any Javascript program like this, we're going to need to do 3 steps:
1. get user input
2. do something with that input
3. attach the input to the HTML page

- Create HTML inputs for day and month
- Grab those HTML inputs with jQuery
- attach event to HTML button
- Console.log to confirm inputs
- declare variable to hold onto output
- we'll need to compare today's date to the birthday entered
Set today and birthday variables
console.log to confirm
- How do we compare these two days? Let's google "get difference between dates javascript"
console.log the output and test different cases:
- birthday 3 days after today
- birthday 35 days after today
- birthday 3 days before today
- birthday 35 days before today

- Limit input of month and day
